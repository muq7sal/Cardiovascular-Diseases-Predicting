# Machine Learning Approaches for Predicting Cardiovascular Diseases
# Project Description:
The proposed project focuses on developing a Machine Learning–based Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) Prediction System that can identify individuals at high risk using medical and lifestyle attributes.
To build this system, the following steps are followed:
1. Retrieve the cardiovascular dataset from Google Drive.
2. Apply data pre-processing (cleaning, feature importance, standardization).
3. Use Fuzzy C-Means clustering to handle data imbalance and improve model performance.
4. Split the dataset into 75% training and 25% testing sets.
5. Train and test the CVD prediction system using ML models.
6. Evaluate model performance and compare results.
# Conclusion of Research: 
In the study's conclusion, a technique that helps doctors correctly diagnose cardiovascular diseases and heart illness is presented. We applied several ML techniques, such as fuzzy C-Means clustering, MLP, SGD, SVM, and QDA, using datasets that contained cardiovascular disease (CVD) data. The combination of fuzzy C-Means and MLP yielded the greatest accuracy rate of 99.93%, demonstrating the tremendous efficiency of these categorization techniques. Accuracy values of 99.93% for MLP, 99.58% for with SGD, 99.46% for SVM, and 97.71% for QDA were obtained by combining each method with Fuzzy C-Means.
